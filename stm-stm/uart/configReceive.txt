Step 2: Receiver (STM32F401RET3) Configuration
Weâ€™ll configure the Nucleo-F401RE to receive "Hello" via USART1 and display it on SWV.

2.1 Create a New Project
In STM32CubeIDE, create a new project.
In "Target Selector":
Select NUCLEO-F401RE in Board Selector.
Click Next.
Name it (e.g., STM32F4_UART_Receive) and click Finish.
Select Yes for default peripheral initialization.
2.2 Configure USART1 in STM32CubeMX
Open the .ioc file.
In Connectivity > USART1:
Set Mode to Asynchronous.
Set Hardware Flow Control to Disabled.
Under Parameter Settings:
Baud Rate: 9600 Bits/s.
Word Length: 8 Bits.
Parity: None.
Stop Bits: 1.
Data Direction: Receive Only.
Verify PA10 is set to USART1_RX (default on Nucleo-F401RE).
2.3 Configure Clock
Go to Clock Configuration.
Set HCLK to 84 MHz (max for STM32F401RET3):
Input: HSE 8 MHz (from ST-Link).
PLL: PLL_M = 8, PLL_N = 336, PLL_P = 4 (adjust as needed).
PCLK2 (USART1 clock) should be stable.
Resolve clock issues if prompted.
2.4 Enable SWV
Go to System Core > SYS:
Set Debug to Serial Wire.
Set Timebase Source to SysTick.
Go to System Core > ITM:
Enable ITM Stimulus Port 0.
2.5 Save and Generate Code
Save (Ctrl+S).
Generate code.
