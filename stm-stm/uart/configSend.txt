Step 1: Sender (STM32L476RGT3) Configuration
Weâ€™ll configure the Nucleo-L476RG to send "Hello" via USART1 and display it on SWV.

1.1 Create a New Project
Open STM32CubeIDE.
Go to File > New > STM32 Project.
In "Target Selector":
Select Board Selector tab.
Search for NUCLEO-L476RG, select it, and click Next.
Name the project (e.g., STM32L4_UART_Send) and click Finish.
Select Yes to initialize peripherals in default mode.
1.2 Configure USART1 in STM32CubeMX
Open the .ioc file.
In Connectivity > USART1:
Set Mode to Asynchronous.
Set Hardware Flow Control to Disabled.
Under Parameter Settings:
Baud Rate: 9600 Bits/s.
Word Length: 8 Bits.
Parity: None.
Stop Bits: 1.
Data Direction: Transmit Only.
Verify PA9 is set to USART1_TX (default on Nucleo-L476RG).
1.3 Configure Clock
Go to Clock Configuration.
Set HCLK to 80 MHz:
Input: HSE 8 MHz (from ST-Link).
PLL: PLL_M = 1, PLL_N = 40, PLL_R = 2.
PCLK2 (USART1 clock) should be 80 MHz.
Resolve any clock issues if prompted.
1.4 Enable SWV
Go to System Core > SYS:
Set Debug to Serial Wire.
Set Timebase Source to SysTick.
Go to System Core > ITM:
Enable ITM Stimulus Port 0.
1.5 Save and Generate Code
Save the file (Ctrl+S).
Click Yes to generate code.
